# ProtGNN: Prototype Graph Neural Network

- This project includes 4 members.
- We introduce XAI methods in graph learning, ProtGNN - Prototype Graph Neural Network. It is a Self-Explaining Graph Neural Network, that combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs. After describing ProtGNN/ProtGNN+, We try to implement again experiments on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00911) and make experimental Evaluation.
